# tache

javascript task runner & build tool

## principles

- no new abstractions. use npm modules & async/await where possible
- everything explicit. nothing magic about how tasks run.
- tasks names are names, not filepaths. filepaths are arguments
- discoverable. can learn about tasks and what they do
- nice output :)
